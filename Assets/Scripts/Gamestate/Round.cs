    /* Readonly Terminology
     * 
     * readonly 
     * attribute makes the member field only assignable during constructor call.
     * 
     * ReadOnlyDictionary 
     * is a "view" (i.e. looking at same underlying values and space in memory as the dictionary it's wrapping)
     *      Using it ensures that we cannot add new entries to the dictionary. (i.e. adding new keys)
     *      It does not however restrict us changing the values pointed to by keys.
     *      
     *      Simply put: 
     *          a ReadOnlyDictionary<int, List<int>> allows for changing the lists the existing integer keys point to
     *      
     * ReadOnlyCollection 
     * is a "view" (i.e. looking at same underlying values and space in memory as the collection it's wrapping)
     *      Using it ensures we cannot add new entries to the collection.
     *      It does not however restrict us changing the values pointed to by the references held by the collection.
     *      
     *      Simply put: 
     *          a ReadOnlyCollection<int> cannot have its entries changed, as they are value types.
     *          a ReadOnlyCollection<PlayerManager> cannot have new or different entries, 
     *              but the fields of each PlayerManager in the collection can change!
